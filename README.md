# EarthGallery
This project is still in development. The ultimate goal is to create a gallery of images of Earth, sorted by color into a gradient.

The images will be sourced from the subreddit EarthPorn all-time highest voited posts [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/top/?t=all).

The planned set of technologies:
    * Python 3.10
    * Firebase & Google Cloud Project
    * Serverless
    * React

This README will be updated as I go along.
